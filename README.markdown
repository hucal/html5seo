# HTML5 SEO Template

Unfortunately, today's aggregators and search engines require different techniques to add metadata to a document. 
This template includes the following metadata:

Twitter card
Facebook's OpenGraph
Google's metadata thing
HTML5 labels


## Using the Template

Fill in the tags marked `TODO` in the `<head>` element of the document.
It's more convenient to use this with a templating engine or with a search-and-replace script.
